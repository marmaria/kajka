Now we will tell you about bears.
The bear is a rather large animal, some representatives can weigh up to 900 lb.! Bears live on all continents. They inhabit the plains and mountains, on the shores of the oceans, in hot and very cold areas. Therefore, there are so many types of them: brown, Himalayan, grizzly, panda, polar bear and many others! Even the marsupial Australian koala is considered a bear, the smallest of bears!
All of them have common features:
short and thick body, the same neck and elongated muzzle. All bears have a small tail.
Some bears dig a den for themselves, others live in hollows of trees or caves. They feed on berries, nuts, roots, love fish, insects and honey. There are bears - predators, and there are - vegetarians.
Sometimes it seems that bears are "clubfoot" - this is because they walk stepping on the whole foot, and their gait looks awkward. These animals differ from others thanks to their ability of distinguishing colors.
