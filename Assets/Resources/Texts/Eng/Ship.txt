Hey!
I am a ship!
I swim on rivers, seas and oceans. Now I will tell you about what water transport is like and what makes it float.
First, people came up with a wooden boat. It was small and could not carry a lot of people and goods. It was increased, and it turned out to be a large ship that could cope with this task, it kept better on the water and sailed through the waves. However, in order to move, the ship needed sails and heavy oars, which the sailors could hardly cope with - it is not easy for a man to make a heavy and large ship sail!
Time turned wooden ships into metal ones, an engine appeared, which facilitated the hard work of sailors. First – steam ships, also called "steamers" appeared, later – diesel ships, for example, modern motor ships started to conquer the oceans. Thanks to the engine, ships can cover great distances and serve for different purposes: for transporting passengers or cargo, for fishing or marine research. You have learned so much about ships! Now rest, for sure, in your dream you will go on a real sea voyage!
