Gray, small, with big ears! Of course it's a bunny or a hair!
Everyone is familiar with hares and love them very much.
Hares live in all parts of our planet. They live in steppes, fields, forests. They eat vegetation: in summer - grass, young twigs and shoots, vegetables;
in winter they gnaw the bark of trees - this is why hares have such strong and long teeth, and these animals are called "rodents".
There are many types of hares, for example: hare, white hare, black-tailed hare and others. Some hares, to protect themselves from predators, change color depending on the season. In winter they are white as snow, and in summer they are gray as the ground - so they are camouflaged so that they are hardly noticeable. Hares have many enemies: wolves, foxes, lynxes, owls and other birds. Fast legs and keen hearing save hares! Hares run so well that they can reach speeds of up to 80 km / h, like a car! They easily climb up the slopes, but down they have to go head over heels :) I wish I could see it!
