Hi, look at the tiger. It is a very dangerous wild cat, strong, fast and big. The tiger looks like a domestic cat, however, its body length can reach as much as 10 feet!
Tigers can be easily distinguished from other felines thanks to their beautiful black stripes and orange fur coat, although white and black tigers are sometimes found as well.
These animals live exclusively in Asia. They can move silently, and they use this skill while hunting, because tigers are predators. During the day they hide in the jungle, and at night they go hunting! Tigers have very good eyesight and hearing, they can jump, swim and even climb rocks. And when the tiger is full and calm, he purrs like a cat, a very big cat ...
