Vroom-vrrrrum! I am a racing car!
I drive at high speeds because I always strive to win the competition! I was made for racing, you know about that?
The very first races took place a long time ago, when you were not yet born, and not only gasoline cars that were new at that time, but also electric and steam ones took part in them! Then 30 km / h was considered a huge speed, which now seems to us very slow.
Racing cars are not like others - they are made according to special rules so that they can gain great speed:
• They are very low so that the air flow forces the vehicle to the ground.
• Wheels are located wider to make the car more stable when cornering.
• The seat for the driver is made in such a way that he almost lies, and does not sit.
In races, cars are divided by size into groups called "formulas": the small cars compete with the small ones, the big cars with the big ones! So I drive with small cars, and sometimes I win! And sometimes I lose - but I don't get upset, instead I constantly train to become an even cooler racer!
