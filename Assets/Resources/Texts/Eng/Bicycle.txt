Hey!
Who do we have here? It's me - a bicycle!
Your best friend in the summer!
Of course, because walks with me are so interesting - you jump on the seat and go! We will go to the playground, to the lake and to the park, ride along unexplored streets, we can drive with friends! The main thing is to drive carefully and follow the traffic rules.
Now I want to tell you about the history of bicycles . The first bicycle in the world was called a "running machine" - it had no pedals. Just like a modern balance bike! At that time, this invention caused delight among people, because before that it was possible to ride only on horses!
Later, pedals were added to the bike, and then it became even more in demand! Surely, you know that once a bicycle had just a giant front wheel, and it would be painful to fall off that ... Over time, the bicycle acquired its familiar now appearance. It is deservedly considered a healthy mode of transport - you do not just ride, but also train your muscles by pedaling.
