I am an airplane!
I fly in the sky.
For sure you have seen me more than once flying high in the skies, so that it seemed as if I was a toy. It's because the further I fly away from the ground, the more I move away from you and the less I seem in size.
Actually, I'm pretty big. Bigger than a car and even a bus! I can fit many, many people and heavy loads that need to be delivered over long distances.
And I deal with this task greatly!
Have you ever noticed that I am a bit like a bird?
My cockpit, where the pilots sit, is like a bird's head
I have 2 wings that keep me in the air;
a tail with which I can change the direction of movement;
a chassis, or foot-like wheels, with which I land and move along the ground.
These are not coincidences - when the airplane was invented, all these details were taken into account, they made me look like a bird, thanks to which I was able to fly! Now you know this and you will remember when you fly somewhere with mom and dad on an airplane - as if on a big and strong bird!
