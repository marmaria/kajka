Hello, look at me!
I am a rocket!
I fly far, far into space! This is even higher than the sky! There, beyond the clouds, where the stars are.
Do you know that rockets were invented many hundreds of years ago in China? They were used to make fireworks! This is a surprise, right?
And only after a while, humans decided to launch the rockets into space because other aircrafts could not enter airless space. There is air around you, there is air in the sky too - airplanes and helicopters while taking off lean on the air. But in space there is no air, there is emptiness, vacuum. I ,as a rocket, donâ€™t need air - I have a reactive force, thanks to which I lift myself at great speed over great distances! And I fly among the stars while you sleep.
