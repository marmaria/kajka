Hey! Do you see the fox? Do you know anything about them?
There are many types of foxes, for example, common fox, arctic fox, fennec fox, corsac, and they all look different. There are foxes with huge ears, red and white, even black ones. It all depends on the area where they live, and they can live in the forest, in the steppe, or in the desert, where they dig a hole for themselves or occupy a badger's hole.
All foxes have a long body, short legs, an elongated muzzle and a fluffy tail in common. The tail is very important for foxes: it plays the role of a wheel, it can warm the animal and with its help the fox covers up its tracks, can you imagine that?!
Foxes are predators, which means they prey on small rodents, birds and beetles. You should not be afraid of them - there are cases when foxes are tamed and live in the same house with a human. It is such an unusual pet!
