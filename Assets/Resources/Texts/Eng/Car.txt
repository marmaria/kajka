Hello, we have known each other for a long time.
I am a car, or rather a "passenger car".
Now you are so used to seeing me. Going out into the street, every day hundreds of cars of different colors, sizes, designs that were made in different countries pass by you.
It was different before!
People rode horses! Horseback riding had been the main mode of transportation for many centuries. People sat on a horse and started to ride!
Later, carriages appeared, in which several horses were harnessed and even used them as public transport. It is carriages that are very similar to early versions of cars.
For a very long time, people could not think of what could make a carriage go without a horse. As a result of experiments, the engine coped with this task, which still performs its role remarkably! The engine needs fuel to work, which is why we always refuel the car in order to go somewhere.
