Hello. Look, here we have a panda! Or the “bamboo bear,” so nicknamed because it eats bamboo! This plant is the main food of the bear, the panda eats it as much as 70 lb. per day!
Panda is a bear with a special coat color: the main color is white,
paws, ears, round spots around the eyes are black. Well, of course, you know them, these cute pandas!
The panda lives only in China, and is protected by law, because there are very few such bears in the world!
