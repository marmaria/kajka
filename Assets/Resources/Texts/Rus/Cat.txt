Kitty! Everyone's familiar pet! Of course you have seen them many times!
They live everywhere: on every continent, on the street and at home - they can be found anywhere.
Short-haired, long-haired and bald, lop-eared and straight-eared, large and small, of completely different colors - a modern man can have a cat of any breed and appearance. All of them have a rounded head, short muzzle, large eyes, sharp teeth and claws, and whiskers which play an important role in their navigation.
Once upon a time, cats were wild animals. Even now, the domestic cat is considered a predator, and, despite the fact that humans take care of it, it can hunt birds and mice, even if it is not hungry. People value cats for their ability to catch pests, which is why they began to be domesticated many thousands of years ago - to protect food supplies from rodents!
Cats have these amazing abilities: they can find their home even if they are very far from it;
when jumping from a great height, they land on their paws; when cats purr, they emit vibrations; many believe cats have healing properties. What do you think?
